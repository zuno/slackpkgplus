# set to '2' to always show the download bar
# set to '3' for a debug mode

# Enable (1) / Disable (0) the official slackpkg blacklist. May be useful to temporarily skip
# the slackware blacklist. You can also override it from command line:
# 'USEBL=0 slackpkg upgrade-all'
USEBL=1

# Add custom option to 'wget'.
# You can solve the repository indisponibility issue by set a timeout here
WGETOPTS="--timeout=20 --tries=2"

# If you want replace wget with another downloader search DOWNLOADCMD in documentation
# at /usr/doc/slackpkg+-*/README
#DOWNLOADCMD="wget -O"

# Use the cache for metadata files (CHECKSUMS.md5,...). Enable it (on) to speedup the slackpkg update
# process by downloading just new files (see README). Disabled by default (off)
CACHEUPDATE=off

# You can download-only by setting DOWNLOADONLY to 'on'. You may (you should) also use it in commandline
# for example: "DOWNLOADONLY=on slackpkg upgrade-all". Useful for large upgrades.
#DOWNLOADONLY=off

# Enable (on) / Disable (off) notification events (see notifymsg.conf)
#ENABLENOTIFY=off

# Enable (on) / Disable (off) the greylist feature. See /etc/slackpkg/greylist

SENSITIVE_SEARCH=on

# Select the show order in dialogbox. Available "package" "repository" "tag" "path" "arch"
SHOWORDER=package

# If two or more repositories contains some same packages, you can specify
# from which repository you prefer to search it.
# The syntax is "<repository_name>:<package_name>"
# Accepts regular expressions. To give priority to an entire repository use "<repository_name>"

# Examples:
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( restricted:vlc )
# OR
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( myrepo )
# 
# if you have two reporitories to give priority you must set both in the same line
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( myrepo restricted:vlc )
#
# if you want to install 'ktown' repository you must set it here
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( ktown )
# and DO NOT MISS to read special instruction on /usr/doc/slackpkg+-*/repositories.txt

# Otherwise you can try to upgrade a package from a repository that contains a package with the 
# same tag of the already installed package. Tipically that means to upgrade a package from the
# same author of the already installed package.
# Note that this method may not works properly where two repositories contains a package with the
# same tag.
# Set TAG_PRIORITY to 'on' to enable this function
TAG_PRIORITY=off

# List repositories you want to use (defined below)
# remember to launch 'slackpkg update' if you modify that row.

# Define mirrors (uncomment one or more mirror; remember to add it to REPOPLUS)
# GPG Note: after adding a repository, you must to run 'slackpkg update gpg'
#           some repositories as salixos or slackel, have a partial GPG support;
#           for that repositories you may need to run slackpkg with 'slackpkg -checkgpg=off ...'
